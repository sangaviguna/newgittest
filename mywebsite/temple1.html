The Meenakshi Temple is the elegant twin temple of Sundareswarar and Meenakshi and the life of Madurai City revolves around this temple. The construction process of the temple began 2000 years ago. Contributions from different rulers and special contribution from Thirmalai Naicker, made this complex to extend by leaps and bounds over an area of 65000 sq.m and people rightly call this temple complex as a City of its own. Four Nine tier Gopurams, One Seven tier Chittirai gopuram, Five numbers of Five Tier Gopurams, Two Three Tier Gopurams and Two Golden Gopurams are the majestic towers of the temple.
