The British started calling it as Ootacamund. Coffee and Tea Plantations and trees like Conifers, Eucalyptus, Pine and Wattle dot the hill side in Udhagamandalam and its environs. Summer temperature is maximum of 25 C and a minimum of 10 C . During the Winter it is minimum 5 C and a maximum of 21 C when it is slightly warmer. This area was inhibited by the tribals called TODA long before any body could venture into this region. Curiously enough, this slice of paradise remained unknown even during the periods of the great Southern Dynasties. It was the Britons who ventured into the riches of the regions during early 1800’s. Development and modernization took after their arrival to Udhagamandalam. This was the Summer Capital of the Madras Presidency during the British Rule. Coonoor - 19Kms, Kothagiri - 31 Kms are the other smaller nearby hill stations.

Legend starts with Lieutenant Ward, an Englishman, who climbed up from the Kunnavan village of Vellagavi to Kodaikanal in 1821 for a survey of Mountain Ranges of Palani. In 1834, J.C Wroughten, the then Sub-Collector of Madras and C. R. Cotton, Member - Board of Revenue - Madras Presidency went up the hills from Devadanapatti and built a small bungalow at the head of Adukkam pass near Shenbaganur. The visit of Dr.Wite in 1836 and his observation about the Hill Station attracted Botanists to Kodaikanal. First two houses named Sunnyside and Shelton, on the South Lake Road, were built between 1844-1845 by American Missionaries. Six more such American families migrated to Kodaikanal. Exotic location at 7000 feet above the Plains brought them up here.
